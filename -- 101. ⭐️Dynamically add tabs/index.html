            Nearly all objects in JavaScript are instances of Object; a typical
            object inherits properties (including methods) from
            Object.prototype, although these properties may be shadowed (a.k.a.
            overridden). The only objects that don't inherit from
            Object.prototype are those with null prototype, or descended from
            other null prototype objects.
