      Terms and Conditions for a Website These Terms and Conditions are a legally binding set of rules about the use of a website. They set out how users may use the site, and what they can and cannot do on the site. For
      example, if a user posts offensive or defamatory content on a website, the owner of the site will want to have Terms and Conditions to fall back on which clearly state that the owner of the site does not permit or take
      responsibility for that offensive content and that any liability (such as a defamation claim) should therefore sit with the user. In addition, the owner of the site may want to have the ability to terminate the user's
      account - and this also will need to be explained in the Terms and Conditions.
